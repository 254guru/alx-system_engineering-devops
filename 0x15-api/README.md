# API
<p>An <em>Application Program Interface</em> (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.</p>

## REST APIs
<p>REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer â€” an almost meaningless description of the most-used web service technology! A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers.</p>
