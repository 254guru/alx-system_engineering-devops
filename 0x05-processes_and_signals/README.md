# Processes and signals

## Linux PID
A PID (i.e., process identification number) is an identification number that is automatically assigned to each process when it is created on a Unix-like operating system.

## Linux process
A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program. Each process is guaranteed a unique PID, which is always a non-negative integer.

## Linux signal
A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.
